# The Hacker News App

A clone of [HackerNews.com](https://thehackernews.com/) using the [News API](https://newsapi.org/). Includes a main news feed featuring top headlines for "technology", a "Popular This Week" section, and a search functionality.

### Project Goals

Apply React and Redux. Making GET requests to the News API to display within app.

### How the app works

Upon the initial load, a main news feed and popular news sidebar is shown. Each article features the title, date, author, source, and description - all deriving from the API; clicking on any article always opens the original article in a new tab. 

Clicking the "Search" button will take you to another page that features an input with a default search term of "programming." Type in any term(s) and the feed will update to show the first 20 results using the News API's "everything" endpoint.

Navigate back to the main page by clicking the "Home" button or the Hacker News logo.

### Remaining Backlog Items

* Adjust for mobile responsiveness.
* Add pagination.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
