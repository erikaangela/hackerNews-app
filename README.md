# Project Goals

Build a HackerNews.com clone using the News API.
Must include main news feed, search functionality, and "Popular This Week" section.

Getting Started

1. At the minimum, there should be three components: searchbar, main news feed, and popular news on the side.
2. The main thing you'll be doing in this project is making GET requests to get information from the News API, and then displaying the results in your component.
3. You'll make two different API requests, one to get the top news on the site (using the "top-headlines" endpoint in the documentation), and one to search everything about whatever search input the user wants to search by, using the "everything" endpoint.
4. To search whatever the user inputs, you can use the "everything" endpoint/url and pass in a value for "q" that's in the url string.
5. That "q" stands for "query" and the value you set it equal to is what the API is going to return search results for, so that's where you put the search value you get from the user.
6. Keep in mind, when the app first loads, there should be news information displayed already, so you can put a default value for "q" when using the "everything" endpoint with whatever topic you want on the homepage when your app first loads. Google "javascript default parameters".
7. Also, when clicks to view an article from your search results, you should open up the url to read the full article in a new tab.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
